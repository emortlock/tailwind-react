Once installed you can import the components and use them as you would any other.

```jsx static
import React from 'react'
import { Button } from 'tailwind-react'

const MyButton = () => <Button fill>Submit</Button>
```

Which when output on the page would give you the following.

```jsx
<Button fill>Submit</Button>
```
