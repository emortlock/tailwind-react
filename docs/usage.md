Once installed you can import the components and use them as you would any other.

```jsx static
import React from 'react'
import { FillButton } from 'tailwind-react'

const MyButton = () => <FillButton brand="primary">Submit</FillButton>
```

Which when output on the page would give you the following.

```jsx
<FillButton brand="primary">Submit</FillButton>
```
